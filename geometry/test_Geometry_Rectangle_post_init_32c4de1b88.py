================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Doctest Usage in Production Code
Issue: The use of doctest in the docstring could potentially expose internal structure or logic if the docstring is accessible in the production environment.
Solution: Remove doctest usage from production code and ensure that testing is done in a separate environment. Use standard testing frameworks like unittest or pytest for testing.

Vulnerability:Post-Initialization Method Naming
Issue: The naming of 'post_init' suggests it could be a special method related to dataclasses, but it is not following the '__post_init__' convention. This could cause confusion and lead to improper subclass usage or initialization issues.
Solution: Rename the method to '__post_init__' if it is meant to be the post-initialization hook for a dataclass, or to a more descriptive name that does not conflict with dataclass conventions.

Vulnerability:Unrestricted Imports
Issue: The import statements include unused modules, which can lead to confusion and potentially import vulnerable or unnecessary code.
Solution: Remove unused imports such as 'NoneType' and 'Self' to reduce attack surface and improve code clarity.

Vulnerability:Incomplete Type Hinting
Issue: The 'post_init' method lacks type hints, which could lead to type-related errors that are harder to detect and debug, potentially resulting in runtime exceptions.
Solution: Add type hints to the 'post_init' method's parameters and return type to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.

================================================================================
Below are the test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `post_init` method within the `Rectangle` class:

1. Test that a `Rectangle` object is initialized with two sides when `post_init` is called.
2. Test that the sides are added in the correct order (first the short side, then the long side) after `post_init` is called.
3. Test that the `short_side` and `long_side` properties of the `Rectangle` object have the `Side` class type after `post_init` is called.
4. Test that the `short_side` has the length provided as `self.short_side_length` after `post_init` is called.
5. Test that the `long_side` has the length provided as `self.long_side_length` after `post_init` is called.
6. Test that both the `short_side` and `long_side` have an angle property of `90 degrees` after `post_init` is called, as a rectangle has right angles.
7. Test that the `next_side` attribute of both `short_side` and `long_side` is set to `None` after `post_init` is called.
8. Test that the `Rectangle` object has exactly four sides after `post_init` is called, assuming the `super().add_side()` method adds two additional sides to form a rectangle.
9. Test that calling `post_init` on an already initialized `Rectangle` object does not add extra sides, maintaining the rectangle's property of having four sides.
10. Test the integrity of the `Rectangle` object by verifying that each `Side` object's `next_side` property correctly points to the next side in the sequence to form a closed shape (if the `next_side` property is meant to be used in this manner).
11. Test that the `Rectangle` object's area and perimeter calculations are correct after `post_init` is called, based on the lengths of `short_side` and `long_side`.
12. Test that any methods or properties inherited from a superclass (not shown in the snippet) that are supposed to be initialized or affected by `post_init` are correctly set up after calling `post_init`.
13. Test that the `Rectangle` object maintains its validity after any subsequent operations that may affect its properties (such as changing side lengths, if such operations are allowed).
14. Test that the `post_init` method does not raise any exceptions when called with valid `short_side_length` and `long_side_length` values.
15. Test that the `post_init` method correctly interacts with any other overridden methods or properties from the superclass, ensuring that the `Rectangle` class's behavior is consistent with its design.

Note that the provided code snippet is incomplete, and the full context of the `Rectangle` class and the `Side` class is not shown. Therefore, some assumptions have been made about the behavior of these classes and their methods. The test scenarios may need to be adjusted to fit the actual implementation details of the classes involved.
